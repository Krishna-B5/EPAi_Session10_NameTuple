Methods added in the repo:
1. dict_approach:
method runs for 10k iteration for different fake profiles and returns   
the most common bloodgroup,  
mean current location,  
oldest person age  
and the average age.  

    This method is executed using Dictionary approach.

2. namedtuple_approach:
method runs for 10k iteration for different fake profiles and returns   
the most common bloodgroup,  
mean current location,  
oldest person age  
and the average age.  

This method is executed using namedtuple approach.

3. stock comparison  
 using namedtuple generate 100 companies from pyfake library and create a random dataset
    for high, close and open of stock value.
    return - max-high stock price, open-stock price and close-stock price.
